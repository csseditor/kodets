          Kodets was founded out of need. Others platforms such as Codecademy and Khan Academy simply did not have the flexibilty and autonomy needed to create a rich learning experience for those in primary and secondary school.
        %p
          Throughout the creation of Kodets, students taking Computing at GCSE and A-Level were consulted in the development of the platform to enure it can be enjoyed by everyone.
